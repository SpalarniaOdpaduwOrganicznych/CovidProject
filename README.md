My project on data analysis, which focuses on the Coronavirus spreading and fatality around the world. The aim of this project is to provide a detailed analysis of the data related to the pandemic, in order to help understand the spread and impact of this patogen.
To begin with, I cleaned the data using SQL, ensuring that the data was free from any errors or inconsistencies. The cleaned data was then imported into Tableau Public, where I used various visualization tools to create interactive dashboards and charts that present the data in a clear and concise manner.
Through the use of these visualization tools, I have been able to gain a deeper insight into the patterns and trends associated with the Coronavirus outbreak. By analyzing the data, I have been able to identify the areas that have been most affected by the virus.
Overall, this project has been a valuable exercise in data analysis and visualization, and has provided me with a greater understanding of the power of these tools in helping to understand complex data.
